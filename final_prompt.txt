We're working on a code review platform. The application is functional and meets basic requirements, but we've been experiencing some intermittent issues that are difficult to reproduce and diagnose:

Data occasionally appears stale or out of sync

Unexpected re-renders in certain components

Performance inconsistencies depending on usage patterns

Cache behavior that doesn’t always match expectations

Team confusion around which state management pattern to follow

These issues aren't blocking, but they're concerning enough that we want to understand what's happening before they escalate.
